        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

        <div class="conclusion">
              <h3 style="text-align: center">What is the position of female artists in the contemporary art world?</h3>Since 1950, opportunities have been made for woman artists. Further, since the rise of the women's art movement in the seventies, one can really speak of an increasement in the number of artworks of woman artists. Talent and perseverance (partly due to good socio-economic conditions) clearly took the upper hand. But the glass ceiling has still not been reached.

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3 style="text-align: center">Are female artworks systematically underestimated?</h3>This question is more difficult to answer in general terms. It depends on the auction house, and how good they know their audience and how good they set the estimated price.
        </div>
        </br>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3 style="text-align: center">What is the position of Sotheby's and Christie's?</h3>They are the two auction houses with the most recorded lots for male artworks as well as for female artworks. At Christie’s, women get a higher hammer price than their male colleagues. At Sotheby's, gains are always made on the hammer price for both genders, but the difference between the two is hardly noticeable. They position themselves more emancipatory in comparison to Christie’s.
        </div>
        </br>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3 style="text-align: center">Is gender bias, country dependent?</h3>It can be concluded that Spain, Austria, United States, Germany, and Belgium are the most emancipatory countries. Concerning the top four countries in the contemporary auction world (USA, UK, China and France), there is no unambiguous outcome noticeable. The US correctly estimated all its hammered works regardless of the gender. Surprisingly, UK scores differently. There, female art is overrated just as in France. China shows itself as a non-woman friendly country and its art is systematically undervalued.

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3 style="text-align: center">Are auction houses gender biased?</h3>Whether auction houses are biased depends on the auction house. It can be concluded from this study that the duopoly Sotheby's and Christie's  estimate their prices differently. At Christies, women get a higher hammer price than their male colleagues. At Sotheby's, gains are always made on the hammer price for both genders, but the difference between the two is hardly noticeable.

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3 style="text-align: center">What is the most female friendly auction house?</h3>The most female friendly auction house is linked to the auction house that estimates the value of the estimated price for women as for men equivalent. For the top five, Sotheby’s is the most female friendly auction house. In general, there are also other auction houses that estimate the prices for both genders the same (e.g. German auction house Kunst - & Auktionshaus W.G. Herr).
